## 10/18/2025 12 PM - Project start  

Hello there! This is my first journal entry to my new project :)

I just found the 3D Model I am going to use for the project. It took me a while especially to understand the different type of licences and which ones allowed me to use it. In the end I went with this one: https://skfb.ly/oPIOZ

I really like the look of it!
WHAT NEXT:
- Find a screen;
- Modify the 3D Model to put on the base the screen, and a RPI Zero W;
- SHIP!

There is just a teeny, tiny problem...
Thus being...
I never modeled ANYTHING. How the hell do I edit that model??
Well, guess I'm gonna find out real soon.!

## 10/18/2025 2 PM - Project specifications  

For this project, I'm gonna make a new version of the 3D model with a base to contain the following:
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (w/ headers;
- A touchscreen that connects to the headers;
- Cable rerouting for power

For the 3D model I'm going to use TinkerCAD since it seems super user friendly especially for a beginner such as me, and ngl I thought it was harder.

WHAT NEXT:
- Finish the 3D Model![Screenshot_20251018_141632_Chrome.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjk4NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5e93db07d0a4dfbcc0ab7fa96790a8d02fc4f417/Screenshot_20251018_141632_Chrome.jpg)

- Get the free stickers :D
- SHIP!  

## 10/19/2025 - Finished 3D Model  

Today I finished the 3D Model! (thanks cosmobona56 for the screen measurements <3)
I think it turned out really great, especially considering it was my first time modeling anything. Here are some pictures of it, LMK what you think!

WHAT NEXT:
- List down the parts
- Get the free stickers
- SHIP!
