## 10/18/2025 - Project start  

Hello there! This is my first journal entry to my new project :)

I just found the 3D Model I am going to use for the project. It took me a while especially to understand the different type of licences and which ones allowed me to use it. In the end I went with this one: https://skfb.ly/oPIOZ

I really like the look of it!
WHAT NEXT:
- Find a screen;
- Modify the 3D Model to put on the base the screen, and a RPI Zero W;
- SHIP!

There is just a teeny, tiny problem...
Thus being...
I never modeled ANYTHING. How the hell do I edit that model??
Well, guess I'm gonna find out real soon.!
